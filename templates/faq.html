        <h1 class="fw-bold mb-4">FAQs</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">How does Study Planner create my schedule?</h3>
        <p>Study Planner analyzes your available time and your scores for each subject, then uses a weighted algorithm to distribute your study time in a balanced and goal-oriented way.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Do I need to manually set priorities for my lessons?</h3>
        <p>No. Priorities are calculated automatically based on your performance, so you don't need to guess which subject is more important.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Why do some subjects get more study time than others?</h3>
        <p>Subjects with lower scores require more attention. The system allocates more time to areas where improvement is needed most.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Can any subject receive zero study time?</h3>
        <p>No. Every subject always receives a minimum amount of study time to ensure balanced learning.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">What happens if I have very limited free time?</h3>
        <p>The planner still distributes your time fairly by maintaining proportional allocation and minimum study durations.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Can I change my plan later?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can regenerate your study plan at any time by updating your scores or available time.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Is my data stored permanently?</h3>
        <p>Currently, your data is only used to generate your study plan. Future versions may include optional data storage for long-term tracking.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Who is this application designed for?</h3>
        <p>Study Planner is designed for students who know what they need to study but struggle with time management and prioritization.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Is Study Planner suitable for all educational levels?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The algorithm is flexible and works for different subjects, scoring systems, and study loads.</p>
